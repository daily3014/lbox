# lmaobox luas made by me
## resolver.lua - automatically resolves antiaim for you
* preview: https://imgur.com/a/j0oWknn
* manual yaw cycle using the "toggle yaw" keybind in lmaobox (antiaim tab)
* supports all aim key modes
* aim position must be "head"
## aabind.lua - binds antiaim to a key
* edit keybind in the lua
## slender.lua - boss esp & page esp for community gamemode slender fortress
* pages only appear when you get close to them
## lnx aimbot.lua - fork of lnx's POC aimbot with added fakelag fix
* very unstable, could crash
* super unfinished
* i dont even know if it even uses the fakelag fix....
